    // 1. Query orders table filtering by order ID and customer ID (for security)
    // 2. Join with order_items table to get all items for the order
    // 3. Join with products table to get product names
    // 4. Return formatted order data with items and product details
    // 5. Return null if order not found or doesn't belong to customer
    
    // Placeholder implementation - returns null
